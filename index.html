                My name is Max Weidmer. I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and at the age of 5 I moved overseas with
                my family to Venezuela, and stayed overseas for the next 13 years, living in Indonesia, the UK, and
                Canada before returning to the US to attend university at UCSB. After a year as a physics major, I’ve
                decided to take a gap year.
            </p>

            <p class="pImg">
                I enjoy reading, running, video games, cooking, and photography. Currently, I’m taking the opportunity
                to learn something almost completely new in web development.
            </p>

                Couldn't think of something to write but needed a paragraph here to show that the positioning is
                correct and that the paragraph will clear the picture.
