## Description
### This is a responsive version of the previous basic portfolio, using media queries at max-widths 980px, 768px, and 640px to organize elements on the page as the screen size is changed.

### At 980 pixels, the header stays mostly the same, but the main content is shrunk and aligned to the left.

### At 768 pixels, the header again stays the same, but the main content is centered in the center of the page. Also, the profile picture is made slightly bigger.

### Finally, at 640 pixels, the header and navbar are stretched to the width of the screen and stacked on top of each other.  Within the main content part of the page, the content now takes up 100% the width of it's container, and all elements are stacked on top of each other.
